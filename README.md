## Project Description : 
The United States Dollar has never been stronger. As of today, in 2022, the USD Index has soared to an all-time high. However, domestic goods are getting any cheaper. I will be analyzing how to take advantage of the strength of the US Dollar in certain foriegn countries for profit or personal gain. The currencies I will be showcasing against the US Dollar are currencies strictly in East Asia. These currencies are the Korean Won, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong Dollar, Taiwanese Dollar, Singapore Dollar and the Thai Baht.

## Project Overview:

The purpose of this project is to identify countries in East Asia where the U.S. Dollar has, or does not have significant purchasing power. 

To fully understand the observation, when going through this notebook, understand that each currency is compared to their own national price. This, for example, means that 1 USD or dollar bill is national recognized of value as 1 dollar. 100 Yen would then be the national equivalent of the USD for Japan.

##### This national equivalent should not be confused with the global exchange rate. 

National Equivalent Prices comparable to 1 USD are as follows:
- 100 Japanese Yen
- 10 Chinese Yuan/Renminbi
- 10 HKD
- 1000 Korean Won
- 1 Singapore Dollar
- 30 Taiwanese Dollar
- 30 Thai Baht

_The information backing these calculations are assumptions of an exchange rate where the respective national equivalent of $1 per country observed equal exchange rates. The research done behind these calculations can be found here:_
